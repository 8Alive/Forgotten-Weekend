Please make sure your RPG Maker MV  software is up to date before using this plugin. -------------------------------------------------- When we create a game, we usually create a whole  new world rich in lore and details, and want to  make it all available to the players, so that  they can understand every single detail we  develop. However, just dumping it all in lengthy  dialogues usually bore and scare most of the  players, who will simply give up on your world. A common alternative used by many AAA games is  to minimize dialogue and exposition, and provide  additional details through in-game books.This  plugin aims to provide just that for your game:  a book menu where the player can read up  additional lore when he feels up to it. You can  place books throughout your game, providing a  bit more of context for hungry players as they  progress, and keeping exposition to a minimum.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Category\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tutorial\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBg\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBgMode\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"11\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\\"{\\\\\\\"Title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Different Scenes\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Title Window Text Color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"7\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This plugin provides two different types of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nscenes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe first one is a detached book window, that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nshows only one book at a time (title and book \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncontents). It is a simpler version meant to be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nused when the player finds a new book while \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nexploring your world. You can set it up so that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthe book will then be made available in the menu \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nso that the player can read it anytime he wants, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor not.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe second scene is kind of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"player library\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIt is meant to be accessed from the main menu \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nand list all books known to the player (you can \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nset it up to show all books EVER, or only those \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthe player has found while exploring).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Category\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tutorial\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBg\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"World\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBgMode\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"11\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\\"{\\\\\\\"Title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Background Images\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The plugin gives a lot of options for you to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nsetup background images on both scenes. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConfigurations are kept separate for each one, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nso you can set different backgrounds for each \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nscene if you wish.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAll images must be in png format and located \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nin the img/pictures folder. The parameters to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nconfig each type of background image is shared \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nby all possible options.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nA warning though, the plugin won't manipulate, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nstretch or shrink images. It will only place \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthe images as they are. It's up to you to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nprovide images on the right size.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nApart from choosing the images, you must also \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ninform the plugin how you want it to present \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthem. Options are a little different between \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nscenes because the Menu Scene has an additional \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwindow (the list window), but the logic is the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nsame. Here's a few things you should know:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - If you set it up as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"None\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", the plugin will \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n paint a black background, with no image;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - If you set \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Default Map Print\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", it will keep \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n the base class default, which is using a print \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n screen from the map the player is located;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - If you set \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Full Background Image\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", the image \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n will be place as a background for the whole \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n screen, regardless of the size of your windows;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - There's a bunch of options saying \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Multiple \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n Images\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and then a combo highlighted between \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n parenthesis, like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Title + Text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Title / Text \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n + List\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", for example. The dash sign (/) means \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n the windows will share a single image, while \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n the plus sign (+) means it will use a different \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n image;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - The option \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Single Image\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will set the same \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n image across all windows in the scene. If the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n scene takes the whole screen, it will work \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n exactly as the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Full Background Image\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". If not, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n it will be placed as best as possible to cover \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n all windows on the scene, and nothing more;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - There are also options to allow you to combine \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n different configurations, so you can customize \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n the background to your liking!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Category\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tutorial\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBg\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Hexagram\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBgMode\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"11\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\\"{\\\\\\\"Title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Custom Backgrounds\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"IMPORTANT: All images will be loaded from the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimg/pictures folder, and they must be in png \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nformat.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nYou can setup custom backgrounds for individual \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbooks, so that it will override the global \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbackground configurations. You may set it to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nshow on the detached window or menu window \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nseparately, or on both, and you can define if it \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwill cover the text window only or both text and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntitle windows. You can't setup different \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbackgrounds for each scene though, for ease of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nuse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWhile using the Plugin Manager to load books, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\njust set the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Custom Background\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" parameter of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbooks to select an image, and the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Custom \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBackground Mode\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to set the custom background \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbehavior. Leave \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Custom Background\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" empty if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ndon't want a custom image to be displayed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIf using a JSON file as datasource, just add a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"customBg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" tag to specify the file name and a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncustomBgMode to define the custom background \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbehavior. The customBgMode tag must be an integer, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nas follows:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 5: Detached Text Window Only\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 6: Menu Text Window Only\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 7: All Text Window Only\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 9: Detached Title + Text Window\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 10: Menu Title + Text Window\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 11: All Title + Text Window\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nJust to clarify, this code is read bitwise by \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthe plugin. That's why it is not sequential. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBits are read as follows:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 1 (least significant bit): Affects the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ndetached window\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 2 (second least significant bit): Affects the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nmenu window\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 4 (second most significant bit): Affects the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntext window\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n - 8 (most significant bit): Affects both text \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nand title window\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDo not include the custom background tags in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nyour JSON file if you don't want to use a custom \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimage for the book, or leave \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"customBg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as an \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nempty string.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Category\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tutorial\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBg\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Sword\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBgMode\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"7\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\\"{\\\\\\\"Title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Inline Images\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Title Window Text Color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The escape code % img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") (no espace \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbetween % and img) can be used to include an \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimage along with the book text in its original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nsize (or resized to fit into window, see next \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nsection). The plugin will always look for images\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nin PNG format in the pictures folder.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEx.: % img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n%img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nYou can also include optional parameters to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nforce the plugin to resize the image to your \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nliking: % img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", width, height) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n(again, no space between % and img). The code \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nparameters width and height are percentile \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nnumbers. For instance, if you want the image to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbe displayed in half its original size use \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n% img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", 50, 50).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEx.: % img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", 50, 50)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n%img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", 50, 50)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEx.: % img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", 40, 20)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n%img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", 40, 20)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOne additional note: images are loaded into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nmemory asynchronously. Which means the plugin \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwon't wait for it to be ready to show the book's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntext. If, however, the image finishes loading \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nand the screen is already showing your book's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntext it will be automatically updated. In other \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwords, slower machines may see the book load \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwithout the image, just to see the screen \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nautomatically update a few seconds later \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nincluding it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWARNING: If you're using a plugin to provide \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwordwrapping functions, you'll need to manually \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ninclude the wordwrap tag before any text that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfollows an inline image. It is required because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nto include such images this plugin needs to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbreak down the book text in sections, and the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwordwrap tag included in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Book Text Format\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nparameter or at the start of the first block of\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntext won't have effect on any text following the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimage.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEx.: < WordWrap>Before an inline image.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n% img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")< WordWrap>After any image.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Category\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tutorial\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBg\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Universe\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"customBgMode\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"11\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\\"{\\\\\\\"Title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Inline Trailing Images\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Title Window Text Color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"%in_img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"alphabet-2010703_960_720\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", 10, 10)ou can insert small images at the start of\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nparagraphs using the escape code \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n% in_img(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"filename\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") (no space between % and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nin_img).

If set to true, an \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nimage bigger then the window width will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nresized to fit (using the same proportion \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfor height).

If you're not, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nleave it as 'false', otherwise you may \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\noverburden your GPU memory for nothing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe reason why this is required, is that when \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nusing wordwrap, the size of your full text is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nnot really known until it is written to screen. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, to provide scrolling we need to know \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nit beforehand. To counter that, this parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nenables a function that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"guesses\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the text \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nonscreen size to avoid the clipped text issue \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwithout stressing the GPU. That guess, though, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nis not possible for both wordwrap and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nnon-wordwrap at the same time.

It has survived not only five \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncenturies, but also the leap into electronic \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntypesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwas popularised in the 1960s with the release of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLetraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nand more recently with desktop publishing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nsoftware like Aldus PageMaker including versions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nof Lorem Ipsum.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Category\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Lorem Ipsum\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\\"{\\\\\\\"Title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"From Where?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nsimply random text. It has roots in a piece of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nclassical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nover 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nprofessor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nlooked up one of the more obscure Latin words, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nconsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ngoing through the cites of the word in classical \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nliterature, discovered the undoubtable source. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1.10.33 of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nExtremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfirst line of Lorem Ipsum, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lorem ipsum dolor \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nsit amet..\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", comes from a line in section \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1.10.32.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nused since the 1500s is reproduced below for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthose interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfrom \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by Cicero \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nare also reproduced in their exact original form, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\naccompanied by English versions from the 1914 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntranslation by H. Rackham.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Category\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Lorem Ipsum\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\\"{\\\\\\\"Title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Why Use It?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is a long established fact that a reader will \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbe distracted by the readable content of a page \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwhen looking at its layout. The point of using \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ndistribution of letters, as opposed to using \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n'Content here, content here', making it look like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nreadable English. Many desktop publishing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npackages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nas their default model text, and a search for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nin their infancy. Various versions have evolved \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nover the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\non purpose (injected humour and the like).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Category\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Lorem Ipsum\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\\"{\\\\\\\"Title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Where Can I Get It?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There are many variations of passages of Lorem \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIpsum available, but the majority have suffered \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nrandomised words which don't look even slightly \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nbelievable. If you are going to use a passage of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nanything embarrassing hidden in the middle of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntext. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nInternet tend to repeat predefined chunks as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nnecessary, making this the first true generator \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\non the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLatin words, combined with a handful of model \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nsentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nwhich looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nis therefore always free from repetition, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ninjected humour, or non-characteristic words \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\netc.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\C[1]Reference:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\C[8] https://www.lipsum.com/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\C[0]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Category\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Lorem Ipsum\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\\"{\\\\\\\"Title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Sample\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Title Window Text Color\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Text\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nadipiscing elit.
